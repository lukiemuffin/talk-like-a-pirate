## Add jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript library intended to make it easy to use JavaScript. The easiest way to enable jQuery is to use a library hosted online, for example by Google.

- Copy and paste this line of code between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags of your page, or if you are using CodePen, paste this line into the HTML box:

  ```html
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  ```
  
Assuming the computer running your pirate speak web page has an internet connection, you should now have jQuery available. If you want to run the generator without an internet connection, **this code will not work** as your computer will not be able to access the library, so follow the instructions from [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp) to download a local copy of jQuery.
